Neil
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Neil…

Alice
And I'm Alice. So Neil, the subject of today's show is superheroes! Who's your favourite?

Neil
Spiderman. He's cool and funny – and he can spin织 webs and jump off skyscrapers摩天大楼!

Alice
Well, my favourite superhero is Ms Marvel惊奇女士.

Neil
I've never heard of her – and I’m a bit on an expert on comic book superheroes.

Alice
Well, a growing number of people from ethnic backgrounds民族背景 are getting bored of all these white male superheroes they can’t relate to没啥关系. And they're hungry for characters a little closer to home接近生活 – or relevant to their own lives.

Neil
So what's Ms Marvel's super power?

Alice
She's a shape shifter – which means she can change shape and become anything she wants. But she's also just Kamala Khan, an average普通的 teenager from New Jersey, who happens to be碰巧是 Asian and a Muslim.

Neil
It sounds good. But I think it must be time for today's quiz question, Alice!

Alice
OK, here it is. What is the name of the new character that replaces Tony Stark as Iron Man? Is it…
a) Miles Morales?
b) Riri Williams?
Or c) Jane Foster?

Neil
I'm going to say a) Miles Morales because he sounds like a man.

Alice
Well, we'll find out later on the show whether you got the answer right or not. Now, I have another question. What are the rules for achieving superhero status? Superman is an alien, Ms Marvel has alien genes, and Spiderman and the Hulk are both contaminated – or poisoned – by radioactive放射性的 substances物质 that change their DNA.

Neil
What about Batman and Iron Man? They're just ordinary guys with a lot of money who use technology to create superpowers for themselves.

Alice
Good point. There don't seem to be any hard-and-fast – or clear – rules. But these special powers – whether it's being able to fly, or change shape, or spin webs – they allow the characters to do good in the world. And that’s a big theme across all comic books.

Neil
That's true. But times have changed, and comic books these days often blur模糊 the line between right and wrong – making things unclear. Superheroes don’t always do the right thing and struggle with与斗争 everyday problems like you and me.

Alice
Let's hear more about imperfect不完美的 superheroes from Jason Ditmer, professor of political政治 geography地理 at University College London.

INSERT
Jason Ditmer, professor of political geography at University College London
They [Marvel Comics] imbued填满 these characters with real human problems. So Peter Parker蜘蛛侠 had just, was sort of有点… one problem after another. The Fantastic Four神奇四侠 was a family and they bickered吵嘴 and fought and Reed神奇先生 and Sue隐形女侠 were a couple, and then they got married, and that had, like, never happened in superhero comics. So these people had lives that others could relate to.

Neil
So publishers – like Marvel Comics – imbued – or filled – their characters with human problems. I can't imagine a character like Captain America worrying about small things – or bickering with his wife!

Alice
And bickering means arguing about things that aren't important. Well, like you said earlier, times change, Neil. These days, the publishing houses出版社 want to attract吸引 a more diverse – or varied – readership读者: teenagers, women, ethnic minorities少数民族 – who want superheroes they can relate to, facing issues from racial discrimination种族歧视 to bickering at home.

Neil
I know that women are indeed interested in superheroes because they've been appearing in movies and on TV, but the world of comic books has always been a bit of a guy thing.

Alice
Well, it isn't. Women read them and in some places women work in them. In Japan for example, we have the manga日本漫画 – these are Japanese comic books for adults and children. And, guess what – there is a strong tradition传统 of female illustrators女性插画家 there.

Neil
Really?

Alice
Yes. Let’s move on继续 now and listen to Dr Casey Brienza, Sociologist at City University in London, talking about manga.

INSERT
Dr Casey Brienza, Sociologist at City University in London
One of the really interesting things about producing comics in Japan is that it's one of the few很少的, kind of一点, autonomous自主 careers that women can have. And so Japan has many, many female comic-book artists who write both for men, women, boys, and girls. And in the United States and in Britain female comic-book artists are far and away巨 a minority少数的.

Neil
Dr Casey Brienza there. So she says female comic-book artists are common in Japan but are a minority in the US and the UK.

Alice
It's particularly特别地 interesting that being an artist is an autonomous career – meaning you have the freedom to make your own decisions - and apparently据说 this is not common for women in Japan.

Neil
And do you know who draws Ms Marvel? Is it a woman?

Alice
No. Ms Marvel is drawn by a man – the Canadian comic book artist Adrian Alphona. But we are running out of time剩下时间不多 so let's go to today's quiz question. I asked you: what's the name of the new character that replaces Tony Stark as Iron Man? Is it…
a) Miles Morales?
b) Riri Williams?
Or c) Jane Foster?

Neil
And I said Miles Morales.

Alice
And you were… wrong, Neil. I'm sorry. The answer is Riri Williams. Marvel Comics has recently diversified使角色多样化 its characters to look more like the world we know today, including the addition of female African-American college student Riri Williams as Iron Man. Marvel has also given Thor's hammer to a woman, introduced a black, Hispanic西班牙美国人 Spider-Man called Miles Morales and created Kamala Khan, a Muslim superhero otherwise known as Ms Marvel.

Neil
Very interesting. Now, let's remind ourselves of the words we learned today:
closer to home
shape shifter
contaminated
hard and fast
blur
imbued
bicker
diverse
manga
autonomous

Alice
And that's the end of today's 6 Minute English. Don't forget to join us again soon!

Both
Bye!
