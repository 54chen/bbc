Catherine
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Catherine…

Neil
And I'm Neil.

Catherine
So, Neil, do you notice anything different about me today?

Neil
Have you done your hair differently?

Catherine
No.

Neil
Is that a new outfit?新衣服

Catherine
Honestly, Neil!讲真

Neil
I give up. I don't know what's different about you.

Catherine
OK. Well, maybe by the end of the show you'll have figured it out. Anyway, today we're discussing memory and whether we can remember things accurately精确地. So are you ready to answer today's quiz question, Neil?

Neil
I am.

Catherine
OK. So in which part of the brain is there an area dedicated to remembering faces? Is it…
a) the temporal lobe?
b) the hypothalamus?
or c) the cerebellum?

Neil
Well, I have no idea. But I'll say a) the temporal lobe.

Catherine
OK and we'll find out whether you chose the correct answer later on in the show. But let's talk more about how our memories can  play tricks on 捉弄 us. We tend to倾向于 think of memory as being like a video recorder that we can replay and recall again and again as it originally原始地 occurred发生. But memory doesn't work like that. It's a reconstructive重建的 process.

Neil
A reconstructive process?

Catherine
Yes. We reconstruct - or rebuild - memories, and during this process, they may be distorted – or changed – for different reasons. Let's listen to Tim Valentine, retired professor of psychology at Goldsmith's College at the University of London, talking about this.

From all those TV dramas电视剧 you've watched you'll be familiar with the forensic法院的 scenes of crimes officers打击犯罪的官员 wearing their paper suits and covering their shoes and their hair to make sure they don't introduce their DNA or physical traces onto（introduce...onto.. 引入） the crime scene. So that in the same way anybody who has any interaction with a witness目击证人 needs to make sure that they don't distort扭曲 their memory.

Neil
So crime officers wear protective clothing at crime scenes so they don't contaminate it with their DNA.

Catherine
That's right. A crime scene is a place where a crime was committed. And contaminated means 'made impure through contact with an outside source'. So for example, if an officer touches something without gloves on, they introduce new information. And once this has happened, you can't get back to the original information.

Neil
Now, Tim Valentine says that when police officers talk to the witness of a crime, they might also introduce new information. And this could change the witness's memory of what happened.

Catherine
And it isn't only police questioning that can distort memory. Other factors such as stress can affect your ability to recall events accurately. For example, if you're being held at knifepoint you are likely to be concentrating on the weapon rather than on your attacker's face. And at knifepoint means 'under threat of being stabbed'.

Neil
So why do we place so much importance on eyewitness accounts目击者?

Catherine
Eyewitness accounts can sound very convincing in court – but in fact according to research, they are often unreliable. Karen Newirth, senior attorney at the Innocence Project in New York, explains this further.

First, I think it's sort of有几分 natural for people to want to believe that memory can be accurate. It's very disconcerting令人不安的 to think that we're going through life relying on our memories and then to learn how mistaken they can be - and how frequently. Second is that the testimony证辞 of eyewitnesses has become a very expected piece of criminal trial刑事审判 so jurors陪审员 sort of anticipate it, look for it, and tend to believe it.

Neil
So we like to trust in our ability to remember things accurately. And it's disconcerting to learn that memory is frequently inaccurate. And disconcerting means…

Catherine
…it means 'confusing and a bit upsetting'.

Neil
Karen Newirth also says that people expect eyewitness testimony – or spoken statements – in court. Do you think that's true, Catherine?

Catherine
Yes – and it's the most commonly used evidence证据 brought against criminal defendants被告 in court, even though they are often inaccurate.

Neil
Are there any ways to improve accuracy?

Catherine
Yes, there are. For example, in a police line-up you can prevent预防 eyewitnesses receiving information from the officer giving instructions, which might influence their response.

Neil
Yes, I see. Well, you didn't give anything away when you asked what was different about your appearance外表 at the beginning of the show.

Catherine
Yes, that's true, Neil. But I can now reveal to揭晓 you that... I'm wearing glasses, Neil. I've lost my contact lenses!

Neil
I don't know how I missed that. Because actually you do look, well, completely different with glasses.

Catherine
Just a bit, yes. So, now we're running out of time, so let's move onto the answer to today's quiz question. Remember I asked: in which part of the brain is there an area dedicated to recognizing faces? Is it…
a) the temporal lobe?
b) the hypothalamus?
or c) the cerebellum?

Neil
I said a) the temporal lobe. Was I right?

Catherine
You were indeed, Neil! Very well done, it was the correct answer!

Neil
Yes!

Catherine
The main part of the brain dedicated to recognising faces – called the Fusiform Face Area 纺锤状脸部区域– is positioned in the temporal lobe, which can be found roughly in the area just behind your ears.

Neil
Fascinating! Now, here are the words we learned today…
reconstruct
distorted
crime scene
contaminated
at knifepoint
disconcerting
testimony

Catherine
And that bring us to the end of today's 6 Minute English. Don't forget to join us again soon!

Both
Bye!
