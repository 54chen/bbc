Alice
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice…

Neil
And I'm Neil. What do you think about autonomous cars, Alice?

Alice
An autonomous – or independent and driverless – car is a vehicle车辆 that is capable of能够 sensing感受 its environment and navigating without human input. I think they're a great idea.

Neil
And navigate means' to find the way to get to a place'. I'm not sure I would trust a computer to drive me. It might go wrong and crash into a wall.

Alice
Maybe, but actually most car accidents involve an element of一点点 human error, and human error means 'the mistakes we make because we're human'. For example, people who are behind the wheel while tired or drunk – or distracted精神不集中.

Neil
Behind the wheel: in other words, in control of a car. Yes, I often see people talking on their mobile phones – or texting – instead of looking at the road.

Alice
They are being irresponsible不负责的 drivers, Neil. Driving is the subject of today's show. I have a question for you. On average, how many people around the world die each day from road accidents? Is it…
a) 300?
b) 3,000?
Or c) 30,000?

Neil
And I'm going to say b) 3,000.

Alice
Well, we'll see if you were right or not later on in the show. Are you a petrol head, Neil?

Neil
No, I'm not a petrol head – which is somebody who loves cars and driving. But I know Eddie Jordan, a racing team owner, is. And what does he love about driving? He'll answer this question himself. Let's listen.

INSERT
Eddie Jordan, racing team owner
When I get in a car I feel a different person, I feel that I'm now in control. I can turn on the music or I can turn it off. I can do all sorts of different things that I feel good about. When I was flat out with the Jordan team I did have a driver and that was one to be able to make calls and to be able to receive calls and to be able to work in the car, not because I didn't want to drive and I always felt cheated被骗 because there was a driver there taking the pleasure that I should be having本该是我享受的乐趣. So when I get in a car it has to be a fun experience.

Neil
Eddie Jordan there. And doing something flat out means 'at maximum capacity'. Do you feel like a different person when you're driving, Alice?

Alice
No. And – unlike Eddie Jordan – I'd love to have a driver or a driverless car, for that matter就这个问题. It gives you time to do other things, like getting some work done. I certainly wouldn't feel cheated of the pleasure of driving!

Neil
I agree with Eddie Jordan. I would feel a bit cheated. And I have to admit承认: I'm a bit of a backseat driver. I sit in the passenger seat and give the driver unwanted advice.

Alice
Well just think, Neil, in a driverless car, you wouldn't need to give the computer advice because it would be making the right decisions to get you to your destination safely.

Neil
But can you override the computer? You know, if you felt that it was making bad decisions?

Alice
Override in this context means 'to stop an automatic action by taking control yourself'. Airline pilots航空飞行员 do that, don't they? They fly on autopilot for most of the journey, but override it in order to take control of the plane for take-off and landing.

Neil
I would feel happier if I could take back control of an automated car if I wanted to.

Alice
Well, let's listen now to Brian Fung, a technology reporter, who's experienced what it is to be in a driverless car that has no steering wheels方向盘, no brake pedals刹车, no emergency brake紧急制动, no gear shifter变速箱. Google is developing a car in which everything will be self-contained.

INSERT
Brian Fung, technology reporter
Well, the biggest thing you notice right off the bat is that the car accelerates加速 a little bit more aggressively积极 than a regular一般 car might and it brakes a little more aggressively than a regular car might but other than that it takes about ten seconds for you to get pretty comfortable. And the car knew how to stop for red lights; it knew how to run through yellow lights, it could detect pedestrians行人 and navigate its way around parked cars. All in all总而言之, it felt very similar to a regular car-driving experience. And I think that's one of the most surprising and exciting things about it – it's how mundane平凡的 it was.

Neil
Brian Fung says he noticed right off the bat that the Google car accelerated and braked more aggressively than a regular car – and right off the bat means 'immediately'.

Alice
But he also says it took him only ten seconds to get used to it and feel comfortable, as the car navigated appropriately正确、适当 and responded to different traffic situations, including pedestrians and parked cars.

Neil
Well, that all sounds very nice, but I think I'd still prefer to be in the driving seat – and that means 'in control of a situation'. You can take the driverless car, and do your work, Alice.

Alice
Well, the future is likely to be all about automated transport自动化运输 – planes, trains, buses, and cars – and you simply won't have a choice, Neil.

Neil
Maybe you'll be allowed to hire a car you can drive yourself, just for fun.

Alice
Maybe. But I like the idea of a future with safe driverless roads.

Neil
I still need some convincing使人信服. And that brings us back to today's quiz question. Can you tell us the answer, now please, Alice?

Alice
Of course I can! I asked: On average, around how many people around the world die each day from road accidents? Is it… a) 300, b) 3,000 or c) 30,000?

Neil
And I said 3,000.

Alice
And unfortunately Neil that's right! Nearly 1.3 million people die in road crashes each year, on average 3,287 deaths a day. That's according to Annual Global Road Crash Statistics.

Neil
Now, here are the words we learned today:
autonomous
navigate
human error
behind the wheel
petrol head
flat out
backseat driver
override
right off the bat
in the driving seat

Alice
And that's the end of today's 6 Minute English. Don't forget to join us again soon!

Both
Bye!
